One could ask why, and would only receive an answer within the fullness of time. What I'm basically saying here, is not to ask WHY I chose blue.</p></font>
<font color="#BFA9A9" face="Arial" size="4"><p><b>This</b> is the <i>second</i> paragraph of <u>colored text</u>. Much like the first paragraph, there is no reasoning behind the color chosen.
Also like the first paragraph, asking will only get you an answer within the fullness of time.</p></font>
