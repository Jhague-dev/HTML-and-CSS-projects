<font color="blue" face="Arial" size="3"><p>This is the first paragraph of colored text. Notice how this text is blue, although there is no specific reason why this color was chosen. 
One could ask why, and would only receive an answer within the fullness of time. What I'm basically saying here, is not to ask WHY I chose blue.</p></font>
<font color="#BFA9A9" face="Arial" size="4"><p><b>This</b> is the <i>second</i> paragraph of <u>colored text</u>. Much like the first paragraph, there is no reasoning behind the color chosen.
Also like the first paragraph, asking will only get you an answer within the fullness of time.</p></font>
